        <h1>Revitalizing a Local Favorite: Responsive Redesign of a Providence Bagel Shop Website</h1>
      </header>

      <section className="project-section">
        <h4>The website of a beloved local bagel shop in Providence, frequented by myself and many others, served as the perfect canvas for a redesign project. Recognizing its potential for a better user experience, I embarked on a journey to revamp the site with a keen focus on functionality, accessibility, and design coherence.</h4>

        <h2>Discovering Design Flaws</h2>
        <p>My connection to the restaurant, coupled with my frequent visits, allowed me to view the website not just as a designer but also as a regular customer. This dual perspective was crucial in identifying key usability issues that detracted from the user experience:
        </p>

          <img src="/static/images/bagelgourmet/originalbagelgourmet.png" alt="Original Bagel Gourmet Wesbite"></img>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Spacing and Symmetry: </b>The close proximity of the logo to the page title and overall lack of symmetry made the site feel cramped and unbalanced.</li>
            <li><b>Visibility and Contrast: </b>Poor contrast between text and background, along with very small text sizes, hindered readability.</li>
            <li><b>Navigation and Flow: </b>Disjointed content and ineffective use of space led to a confusing navigation experience.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p>
        A detailed report from WebAIM's WAVE tool confirmed these observations, highlighting numerous instances of low contrast and small text, alongside a complete absence of aria labels, making the site virtually inaccessible to users with visual impairments.

        <h2>Speed Sketching to Wireframing</h2>
        <p>
        The redesign process began with speed sketching, where I produced nine quick sketches to explore various visual and structural layouts. Elements from the most promising sketches were then combined to create a clear, functional design that respected the identity of the bagel shop while enhancing user engagement.
        </p>

        <p>
          Moving to wireframing, I developed layouts for tablet, mobile, and desktop views. Each design addressed the initial shortcomings:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Spacing and Use of Space: </b>I introduced adequate spacing between elements and made efficient use of the available space.</li>
          <li><b>Contrast and Visibility: </b>I ensured strong contrast between the text and its background to enhance readability.</li>
          <li><b>Symmetrical and Logical Layout: </b>Features were symmetrically aligned, and interactive elements like buttons and text boxes were arranged to support a natural flow of information.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This project taught me the profound impact of detail-oriented enhancements on accessibility and overall user experience. Although the process required meticulous attention to detail, the outcome was a cleaner, more inviting, and inclusive website.
